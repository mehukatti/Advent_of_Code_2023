Day 4

Part b:
* The rules changed a bit
* There is no points
* You win more cards equal to the number of winning numbers.
* The cards you win:
    * Copies of the cards you have below the card in question.
    * (Card 10 has 5 winning numbers, you now have two 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
* The winned copies are scored the same (you get multiple copies) and they have the same card number as their original card (e.g. cards 11-15)
    * Repeat until copies do not generate anymore copies.
    * How many total copies you have?
        * I assume first that the point is to check all copies of all cards (not to stop at first card with no wins)
